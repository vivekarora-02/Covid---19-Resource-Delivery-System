# Covid-19-Resource-Delivery-System
Basically, the code would be programmed in such a way that it is able to deliver us the required 3information. The availability of resources which are required for the treatment of covid-19 and, is logistically the best and the most efficient route for the Covid-19 Resources to get delivered to the hospitals which are in need, from the nearest Warehouses.
In this project, we have considered the map of Noida. We have taken 8 busiest hospitals, where
the number of patients administering on a daily basis is above 100, and 3 warehouses which are
handling the maximum workload of the area and where the Resources are stored.
Initially, the user would be asked for the Hospital’s name, where the resources are required.
Then, the program would ask for what resources are required in that hospital, for example,
oxygen cylinders, injections, medicines, etc. The owner of the warehouse will input the amount
of the respective resources their warehouse has in stock.
This is where the main objective of the code comes into play. Now, the program would display
the availability of different items which are in stock in different warehouses, and the best
possible route from the Warehouse to the Hospital. The availability of the specific item and the
Total Time the resource would take to get delivered to their destined location would always be
calculated and displayed.
The time shown would also consider all the traffic on these routes. And, The Traffic’s
Congestion Level would be divided in 10 Levels, with Level 10 Traffic being the most congested
one. We would be using linked list, graphs, OOPS to execute the tasks mentioned above
